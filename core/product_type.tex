Stadia can be classified as an augmented service as the main purchasable is a subscription-based service that can't be access without a sufficiently high internet speed connection (a minimum of 10Mbps according to their website \cite{stadiaSupport}) so it can't 
be a product as a product must be tangible and can be consumed at will without a special requirement(internet connection).

As for the augmented part, Stadia subscriptions include (optional) products to use 
with the service such as the Stadia controller.

experience.
