Before discussing the promotion strategy, let's define promotion types first.

\subsection{Promotion Types}
The Economist Times classifies \cite{promoTypes} promotion into:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Press Releases.
    \item Advertising.
    \item Consumer Promotions.
    \item Trade Discounts.
    \item Freebies.
    \item Incentive Trips.
    \item Awards.
    \item Personal Selling.
\end{enumerate}
In the next subsections, we will discuss the different promotion techniques that google used with stadia.

\subsection{Press Release}
First and most notable way google promoted stadia was through their press release (conference) on March 2019 \cite{press}.

\subsection{Advertising}
Google has a huge advantage in advertising compared to its competitors (Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.)
Most of google's revenue comes from ads \cite{googleRevenue}. 

Google collects huge amounts of data to assist the advertisers in finding their target users. 
This data can help google a lot on choosing their target customers.
Google competitors don't have such huge amount of user data.

Nevertheless, Google didn't use that advantage very well. 
On its first trailer on Nov 19, 2019 \cite{stadiaTrailer}, stadia faced huge dislike from the gaming community.

According to many commenters \cite{redditCrit}, bloggers \cite{kotakuCrit} \cite{ccn} and youtubers \cite{rerezCritTrailer} , the trailer felt randomly generated and `trying so hard' or felt cringy.
Apparently, Google failed to understand its customer base, and didn't tailor the trailer very well for them.
